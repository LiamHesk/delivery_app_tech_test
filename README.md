Just a couple points about my work:
<br/>
<p>Not entirely sure what validation you want on the login and order pages, as the provided POST request only seems to return a token on successful login, but then there is no request to make use of said token?</p>
<p>Due to it being a small project I didn't go through the effort of implementing proper ThemeData classes, so the styling is a little lazy.</p>
<p>I normally would have broken down the functions for buttons into their own files for tidier frontend code (as you can see with some of the other widgets), but thought i'd focus more on getting the implementation right for the logic on those sections rather than having the code in different areas.</p>
</br>
Thanks for your time and for looking at my attempt at your tech test!
