Just a couple points about my work:
<br/>
<p>Due to it being a small project I didn't go through the effort of implementing proper ThemeData classes, so the styling is a little lazy.</p>
<p>I normally would have broken down the functions for buttons into their own files for tidier frontend code (as you can see with some of the other widgets), but thought i'd focus more on getting the implementation right for the logic on those sections rather than having the code in different areas.</p>
</br>
Thanks for your time and for looking at my attempt at your tech test!
